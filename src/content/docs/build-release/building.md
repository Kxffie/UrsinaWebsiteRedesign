### Using ursina.build

To build your Ursina application, open the command prompt in your project folder and run the following command:

```bash
python -m ursina.build
```


This command will move the necessary files to a 'build' directory, which you can then distribute.

### Command Options

- `--ignore`: Add assets to ignore.
- `--name`: Change the project name.
- `--include_modules`: Include extra modules like this: `--include_modules module_one,module_two,module_three`.
- `--overwrite`: Don't ask to overwrite existing builds, just overwrite.
- `--skip_engine`: Skip copying the Ursina game engine files.
- `--skip_game`: Skip copying game scripts and assets.
- `--compile_to_pyc=True`: Compile Python files to bytecode (default).
- `--compile_to_pyc=False`: Do not compile Python files to bytecode.

Ensure to include any extra modules with `--include_modules PIL,numpy`, for example. Any errors that occur while the application is running will be logged in `log.txt` instead of the console.

    - `panda3d`
    - `direct`
    - `ursina-3.1.0.dist-info`
    - `ursina`
    - Add any other files included for your app/game. You can find these in `YOUR_PYTHON_FOLDER/Lib/site-packages/`.
